<h2>A New Extinct Emydid Turtle from the Lower Pliocene<br />
of Oklahoma</h2>

<h4>By</h4>

<h3>EDWIN C. GALBREATH</h3>


<p>In the summer of 1946 a party from the University of Kansas
Museum of Natural History visited exposures of the Laverne formation
in Beaver County, Oklahoma, at the invitation of Dr. Stuart
Schoff of the United States Geological Survey. When examining
the marl beds an Emydid turtle was discovered which appears to
be an unnamed species of the genus <i>Chrysemys</i>. A description of
the new species follows.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Chrysemys limnodytes</b>, new species</p>

<div class="pblockquot"><p><i>Holotype.</i>&mdash;University of Kansas Museum of Natural History No. 7676,
vertebrate paleontological collection, a turtle consisting of a fragmental anterior
portion of a carapace, left part of the plastron, and several marginals
collected by the 1946 paleontological field party of the University of Kansas
Museum of Natural History.</p>

<p><i>Geological Age and locality.</i>&mdash;Marl beds of the Laverne formation, early
Pliocene age, in SW 1/4 Sec. 15, T. 4 N., R. 25 ECM, Beaver County, Oklahoma.
The specimen was removed from the marl immediately below the fossil
leaf zone (see Chaney and Elias, 1936; Frye and Hibbard, 1940).</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size large (see measurements) and differing from other species
of <i>Chrysemys</i> in having: The anterior end of the carapace broadly concave,
the posterolateral marginals not greatly flared, the posterior end of the plastron
broadly indented, the carapace more sculptured and relatively wider.</p>

<p><i>Description of type.</i>&mdash;The specimen had been badly damaged before preservation,
and had suffered further damage from exposure before discovery. The
anterior and posterior lobes of the plastron had been folded over the bridge,
forming a three-ply thickness of bone. Of the carapace, only the following
parts are known: Fragment of the nuchal; right 1st, 7th, 8th, and 9th marginals,
left 1st, 2d, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 11th marginals; costals 1-5 on the right
side; costals 1-4 on the left side; and 1st, 2d, 3d, and 4th neurals. The left
half of the plastron is relatively complete, lacking only the epiplastron and
entoplastron. The left 7th, 8th, and 9th marginals are joined to the plastron
at the inguinal buttress, and the right 7th, 8th, and 9th marginals are attached
to the fifth costal. The carapace has smooth contours with no keel present,
but on the lower half of the costals there are seven or eight ridges, and the
remaining surface of the costals and neurals are rugose. The marginals lack
ridges, and the posterolateral marginals are not serrated. The anterior end of
the carapace has a broad shallow notch. The first neural is rounded, and the
2d, 3d, and 4th are hexagonal, with the broad ends forward. Anterior margins
of the 2d and 3d neurals are concave, and the anterior margin of the 4th neural
is straight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>The sulci bounding the scutes are moderately impressed. The width of the
first vertebral scute, anteriorly and posteriorly, is less than the width of the
second vertebral scute. The costal scutes join the marginal scutes on the
marginal plates.</p>

<p>The plastron, broadly indented at the posterior end, does not have the
posterior lobe flared laterally as it is in Recent species of <i>Chrysemys</i>, and lacks
any pronounced notch at the femoro-anal suture. The humero-pectoral sulcus
crosses the plastron behind the entoplastron in a straight line, and reaches the
border anterior to the axillary notch. The pectoro-abdominal suture is anteriorly
convex at the sides and concave at the midline.</p>

<p>A comparison of this carapace and plastron with a series of specimens of
Recent <i>Chrysemys picta</i> and <i>Pseudemys scripta</i> of approximately the same
size reveals characters indicated in the following chart:</p></div>

<p>Hay attached considerable taxonomic importance to the characters of the
nuchal and I find its characters to be fairly constant in the specimens of
Emydidae examined. Although the nuchal of <i>Chrysemys limnodytes</i> is incomplete,
it can be distinguished from the nuchals described by Hay as types
of his several fossil Emydids. Differences in the nuchal, together with those
in the carapace and plastron, serve to distinguish the species from other genera
of the Emydidae.</p>

<p>When the specimen is compared with <i>Chrysemys timida</i> Hay, of the Nebraska
Pleistocene, many similarities, mostly of generic rank, are seen.
<i>Chrysemys limnodytes</i> is broader in relation to length than is either <i>C. timida</i>
or any Recent specimen examined of the same size. The greatest allowance
possible in estimating the length of <i>C. limnodytes</i> fails to bring the ratio of
its breadth to length within the range of Recent specimens of similar size.
Data from 96 specimens of Recent <i>Chrysemys picta</i> show that the ratio of
length to width is not affected by sex, but that the ratio does vary with the
age of the specimen. In young animals the length and width are approximately
equal, but with further growth the length becomes relatively greater. Specimens
in the length group of 135 to 144 mm. have the widths ranging from 71
to 81 per cent of the lengths. In all specimens larger than this, the ratio is in
the low seventies, and the largest specimen, 177 mm. in length, has the width
of the carapace amounting to only 74 per cent of the length. The fossil species,
<i>C. timida</i>, with a length of 160 mm., has the width amounting to 75 per cent of
the length, and <i>C. limnodytes</i>, with an estimated length of 180 mm., has the
width amounting to 80.5 per cent of the length. <i>C. timida</i> is widest anteriorly,
whereas <i>C. limnodytes</i> and the other species of the genus are widest posteriorly.
Less obvious differences between the two fossils are the narrower anterior margin
of the nuchal, the concave anterior end of the carapace, the sculptured
surface of the carapace, and the relatively wider neurals and longer vertebrals
of <i>C. limnodytes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Noteworthy is the intermediate nature of <i>C. limnodytes</i>
when compared with species of the genera <i>Chrysemys</i> and
<i>Pseudemys</i>. However, any resemblance to <i>Pseudemys</i> is not to be
considered as evidence that <i>C. limnodytes</i> is in any way ancestral to
the genus <i>Pseudemys</i>. The fossil specimens of <i>Pseudemys</i> from the
Pliocene are too poorly known to allow the student certainly to
place them in their correct systematic positions. The fossil Emydids
from Western Europe, listed as species of <i>Chrysemys</i>, differ very
much from this species, or belong to other genera of the family.</p>

<p>Only a few turtles are known from the Laverne formation. Hesse
(Chaney and Elias, 1936) reported a small <i>Testudo</i> from the Laverne
of Beaver County, Oklahoma, but neglected to state whether
it was among the material borrowed by him from the University of
Kansas Museum of Natural History. The Museum has an incomplete
carapace and plastron (No. 3101) of a small <i>Testudo</i> from
that locality and formation. In Harper County, Oklahoma, the
field party from the University recovered a large number of fragments
of a large <i>Testudo</i>. Although this specimen is as yet unprepared,
enough fragments have been pieced together to reveal that
the tibia is 127 mm. long. This dimension and those of some of the
fragments indicate that the animal may have been four to five feet
long.</p>
